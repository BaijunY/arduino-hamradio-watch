          OPEN HAM WATCH v. 1.0 - IK8YFW - 2015

This is an OpenSource project based on Arduino platform, for building a smart watch with some
interesting functions: OLED Display, clock RTC, Satellite pass prediction routine, Moon phase 
routine, multi Alarms user and Satellite approaching alert, power safe, DST, Timezone and dual time.

This watch with use a Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers 128x64 size display using I2C 
to communicate.

NOTE: This software use the Adafruit SSD1606 and GFX dispay libraries to connect the oled display. 
These libreries can be downloaded from Adafruit site.

TO build the software you must download the SSD1606 and GFX libray from adafruit:
